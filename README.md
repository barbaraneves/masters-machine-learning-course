# Machine Learning Course Exercises Repository
This repository was created to store the exercises for the Machine Learning course of the Master's in Computer Science program at Federal University of Cear√° (MDCC/UFC). The exercises include implementations of algorithms studied during the course.

## Exercise Lists

### List 1 - Linear, Polynomial and Regularized Regression
The first exercise list covers the following topics:

- Linear Regression 
- Polynomial Regression
- L2 Regularization

The exercises involve implementing the algorithms and applying them to real datasets.

[**Click here**](https://github.com/barbaraneves/masters-machine-learning-course/tree/main/Lista%201) to access the List 1 folder.

### List 2 - Logistic Regression and Statistical Methods
The second exercise list covers the following topics:

- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
- K-Fold Cross Validation

The exercises involve implementing the algorithms and applying statistical concepts to solve machine learning problems. 

[**Click here**](https://github.com/barbaraneves/masters-machine-learning-course/tree/main/Lista%202) to access the List 2 folder.

## Repository Structure
Each exercise list is stored in a separate folder in the repository. The folder name follows the pattern "_Lista_ X", where X is the list number.

Inside each folder, there is a .ipynb file with the answers, and a pdf file with the exercise list.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! If you find an error in the exercises, have a suggestion for improvement, or wish to add new exercises, feel free to create an issue or send a pull request.
