# Machine Learning Course Exercises Repository
This repository was created to store the exercises for the Machine Learning course of the Master's in Computer Science program at Federal University of Cear√° (MDCC/UFC). The exercises include implementations of algorithms studied during the course.

## Exercise Lists

### List 1 - Linear, Polynomial and Regularized Regression
The first exercise list covers the following topics:

- Linear Regression 
- Polynomial Regression
- L2 Regularization

The exercise in the first question involves implementing and evaluating regression models (OLS, GD, and SGD) on a dataset (artificial1d.csv) with two columns (x and y). The models' parameters, MSE, and resulting lines are presented. In the second question, the exercise focuses on a dataset used for predicting median house prices in California districts during the 1990s. It includes steps such as data splitting, training 13 polynomial regression models using OLS, and reporting RMSE for training and testing. L2 Regularization, data normalization, and the creation of graphs for training and testing are also incorporated.

### List 2 - Logistic Regression and Statistical Methods
The second exercise list covers the following topics:

- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)
- K-Fold Cross Validation

The exercise in the first question involves implementing and evaluating binary classification models (Logistic Regression, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) on a breast cancer dataset. In the second question, the exercise focuses on evaluating multiclass classification models (Softmax Regression, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, and Gaussian Naive Bayes) on a vehicle dataset for classifying vehicles into four classes. Both models in each question are assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, and the average and standard deviation of accuracy are reported.

### List 3 - KNN and Decision Trees
The third exercise list covers the following topics:

- K-Nearest Neighbors, with Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances
- Decision Trees, with impurity indices of gini or entropy
- K-Fold Cross Validation

The exercise involves implementing and evaluating binary classification models using KNN and Decision Tree approaches on a dataset of NASA source code attributes, and reporting the average value and standard deviation of Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-score for each model.

## Repository Structure
Each exercise list is stored in a separate folder in the repository. The folder name follows the pattern "_Lista X_", where _X_ is the list number.

Inside each folder, there is a .ipynb file with the answers, and a pdf file with the exercise list.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! If you find an error in the exercises, have a suggestion for improvement, or wish to add new exercises, feel free to create an issue or send a pull request.
